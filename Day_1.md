## Industrial-Winter-Training

*_Day 1_*<hr>

**Date :** 2/1/2019

**Time:** <br>10.00 am ......*Waiting*<br>

Okaay! Lets start of with the experiences straight away.

**Destination :**
Substation and Residential complex of Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Ltd.(AEGCL)<br>
Sarusajai 220/132/33 kV Grid Substation.

**Training Period :** 2 Jan onwards

So were eight of us from Assam Engineering College.To start of with the training we were taken to the high voltage side i.e. the 220 kV side of the Substation.There was a loud enough buzzing sound in that part which was told would only come out from a 220kV side but would not hear the same in 133kV side or 33kV side.

The flooring was all sand and peebles.

First of all the electricity generated passes through the LA or Lightening Arrester which is a protective components thus marking he first stage of the station.It is directely connected to earth to avoid excessive leakage or transmission of current.The main compound used there is ZnO2 which when becomes extremely conductive blasts the LA.

Then the next stage is CVT(Capacitive Voltage Transformer).

Then comes the Wave Trap which ensures the passage of on 50Hz frequency component and the other higher frequency components are passed on and filtered in PLCC(Power Line Carrier Communication).

The next part is that of CT(Current Transformer).Its main function is metering and protection. It has various number of cores depending on the voltage line i.e. 220kV line has 5 cores, 132kV line requires 3 cores and the 33kV line has 2 cores.Its a step down transformer.A term accuric trus was introduced at this level which specifies the tolerance levels of safety.

The 1st core used in this 220kV line is for Metering.
The 2nd core used in this 220kV line is for Protection.
The 3rd core used here is for Special Protection.
The 4th core used here is for Backup Protection.
The 5th core used here is for allowing around 10 times current to pass.
Thus extentive safety and protections are used at this end.

The next stage is the isolator stage.There are two types of Isolators- Single Break and Double Break Isolator.Here the single break Isolator is  used.It has a very very low resistance of 1 milliohm. This Resistance check is done via Constant Resistance Meter or CRM which has a resistance of the range 1 microohm.

If there is some fault in this stage of CPM the system trips. The response time of fault detection in a substation is done by a circuit breaker.Infact the first fault detection in any substation is done by a circuit breaker.

Then we were plates in the conductor lines which were 11 of them whose simple function is to provide resistance.At this point we were introduced of an instrument called Megger.

The overhead naked conductors are either suspension type of tension type.For a 220kV line the conductors are connected in Zebra type and in 133kV the conductors are connected in Panther type.

Then we were informed about auxilliary bus,main bus and extended bus and the problems encountered due to hotspots. We were also the probable area of hotspots i.e. near the clamps,near the connecting ends.

To end the day we were shown the transformer oil testing with the help of BVT or Breakdown Voltage Test.

*So I think thats quite a bit for a day to be learnt.After not being aware of 90% of the stuffs mentioned towards the beginning I think I can call this day a good start of the training period.*
