**Day 2**<hr>

Time : 11.45 am

Today the Training was taken over by the Deputy Manager of the the AGCL Sarusajai Substation along with around eight students from BBEC. A team of 12 altogether was engaged in the training program today.

The topic covered today was that of Transformers.
Electrical transformer is a static device which transforms electrical power from one circuit to another without any direct electrical connection and without changing frequency of power on either side but maybe in different voltage levels with the help of mutual induction.

The total capacity of the Substation  was 300MVA taken care of by three transformers,each of 100MVA.
All the transformersusd here are autotransformers.
Auto transformer is kind of electrical transformer where primary and secondary shares same common single winding. So basically itâ€™s a one winding transformer adding a lot
of advantages as compared to general transformers like nearly 50% rducction in size then general transformers,cheaper,less ohmic loss and copper loss, better voltage regulation as voltage drop in resistance and reactance of the single winding is less.

The various parts of the transformers covered in the practical demonstration were :
1. Bushings:Since the transformers we saw were of very very high capacity thus there were huge bushings.

2. Heat Radiator: It gives the Oil Force when the transformer heats up and are used for cooling of the transformer oil.

3. Cooling Fans: It give Air force when the transformer heats up.There wre five of them on either side of the transformer.

4. Conservator Tank: Its a big cylindrical shaped tank used to provide adequate space for the expansion of oil when transformer is loaded or when ambient
                     temprature changes.

5. Breather:It sucks the moisture content with the help of Silica Gel crystals inside it so that dry air can be taken by the transformer.

6. Buchholz Relay Box: Its a box present between the connecting pipe to the conservator tank.It trips and stops the entire setups when there is internal fault in he system.
                    There can be many internal faults like decomposition of Oil etc.It consists of and alarm and trip circuit for safety purpose.It is a very sensitive gas and oil
                    operated instrument which safely detect the formation of gas or sudden prssure inside the oil transformer.

7.Marshalling Box: It is a big safety indicator box consisting of a lot of indicators. T
                   The two major indicators are
                   1.WTI or Winding Temperature Indicator,used to show the temperature of transformer winding.
                   2.OTI or Oil Temperature Indicator,used to show the oil level in the transformer.
8. Explosion Vent:It is used to discharge excess presure in the atmospher when excess pressure is developed inside the transformer during loading.
                  
Then we were introduced to a concept of Single Phasing.
In simple words,it is the condition when one phase out of the three gets disconnected allowing more heat in one winding then the other two(which is in series now i.e. aftr single phasing) resulting in damage of the qipmnt in long run. 
But the motor will continue to run in two active phases with vibrations and reduced speed. However depending on the loading conditions, the motors may/may not start on two phases.

Single phasing is not desirable for the proper operation of the induction motors and appropriate measures should be taken to protect the machine.
One of the protective measures which is used in that substation is the Single Phase Protector which has its automatic or manual control in the marshalling box.

We moved on to another transformer. We were informed about the three windings of a transformer i.e. The Primary Winding,The Secondary Winding and the Tertiary Winding The former two windings are star connected and the latter is delta connected.
The secondary windings here makes the use of OLTC or On Load Tap Change which is a Tap Changer contected to the primary instead of a completely seperate secondary winding circuit.
The tertiary winding(*heard for the first time*) however is used to give low power to the households which is not satisfied by the secondary voltage generated.

There is a neutral point in each transformer setup through which leakage current passes through the ground as an additional protection from undesirable accidents.

There are three LA or lightening arrestors on either side of the transformers to protect the devices from lightening currrent by passing the entire lightening surges to earth.There are other arresters which are used to ground the switching surges called as surge arresters.

We also learnt about the positional constraints of the lightening mast at the top.It is a single long pole which is raised to a height of few meters made of alumunium steel or galvanized iron.The area arount the mast which is protected is called cone of protection.
The area on the ground which is within 30 degrees from from top of the mast lies within the "cone of protection".

The transformers were fully earthed with the help of metal strips connected to the earth from every end.
