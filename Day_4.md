## Day 4 <hr>

This is the last day of the Training Program. We were taken to the Control Panel Room.
First of all the battery backup bank were made familiar to us.The substation had both DC Battery Backup as well as the electrolytic battery backup cells.

Then we saw the panels from the feeders of various substations and gained a brief idea about how the controlling action takes place in any substation.

With this we concluded our Training Program in AEGCL, Sarusajai Substation.
