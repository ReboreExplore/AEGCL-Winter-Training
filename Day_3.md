# Industrial-Winter-Training

*Day 3*<hr>

This is the third day of my AEGCL internship *and ughhh* you realize you will be taught the same thing that you were taught a day before.

We thus again moved to the high voltage side of the substation to start by our then instructor,the Deputy Manager of the substation(*Thank god we have a different instructor this time or it would have been like rewinding the previous day*).
To start off with there were six Feeders- 2 from Samaguri,Nagaon which are 220KV stations, 2 from Karbi-Longpi which are 100MWatt stations and 2 stations from Mirza which is a 400KV Station.

The conductors used here are ACSR Zebra Conductors.
From the generating ends it enters the substation with the first component being the Lightening Arrester or LA which is used for the protection of the equipment at the substations against travelling waves by diverting the abnormal high voltage to the ground without 
affecting the continuity of supply.There are lightening resisters for each feeder at the entry point to the high voltage side of the substation.

The next stage is the CVT or Capacitive Voltage Transformer of the High Voltage side of the substation which is a transformer used in power systems to step down extra high voltage signals and provide a low voltage signal, for metering or operating a protective relay.
Next we come accross Wave Trap which is a device  that allow only a particular frequency to pass through it and it filters the signals coming on to it . So a wave trap is connected between buses and the transmission line which allow only 50 Hz signal to pass through it.
In substations it is installed  for trapping the high frequency communication signal sent on the line from remote substation and diverting them to the telecom panel in substation control room. 
These high frequency signal should not be coming on the buses as these may damage the equipments.

Here we were also told about PLCC(Power Line Carrier Communication System) which allows communications amoung various substations without any financial dependence on any telecom network.
Another device encountered here is the LMU or Line Matching Unit which is also known as coupling device which matches the output impedance of PLCC equipment with the impedance of transmission line for maximum power transfer.

The next component is the Current Transformer which is extensively used for metering and protection of the current relays in the substation with a connected ratio of 800:1,thus can take power upto 274kW but only 130kW iss permitted in the substation.
The other details were clearly explained n the first day.

The Next component is the isolator which is a disconnector or a disconnecting switch which isolates the faulty section of the substation meant for repair from the healthy section of the substation in order to avoid occurance of more severe faults.
They are located on either side of the circuit breaker.They are operated on no load thus do not have any rating for current making or current breaking.

*Note* :It is mechanically interlocked with circuit breaker. It means it cannot be open until breaker is not open. Similarly breaker cannot be closed until Isolator is open.

The next component is the circuit breaker.Circuit Breakers are used for protection of the substation and its components from the over currents due to short circuit or any other faults.
Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation.

Circuit breakers are often connected with the relays. Relays senses different abnormal condition and gives trip command to the breaker.
These circuit breakers have the ability to break very high currents and quench arcs that are produced as a result. Different quenching media used for this purpose are SF6,Oil,Vacuum,Air.

Then comes the bus bar which is a metallic or copper strip that have a specific voltage and frequency which serves as a connection point for the incoming and outgoing line in the substation.
Apart from providing connection points bus bars increases the reliability of substation i.e.if one incoming is out of service, the whole substation can be energized by energizing the bus using any other incoming line.
Incoming lines are terminated on HT busbar and the outgoing lines are connected on LT bus bars.For example in 220kV/133kV substation, there will be 220kV bus bar and 132kV bus bar. The voltage transformers are connected on Bus bars.

These are classified into different types like single bus, double bus and ring bus.The bus bar in this substation was a double bus bar.

Similarly the same components were present in the 133kV and 33kV side,with only the ground clearance height decreasing as we move towards the high voltage side.

*So with this the field visit was over and we called off this day.*
