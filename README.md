# AEGCL-Winter-Training
An Industrial Training during by 3rd Undergraduate Year as a part of my curriculum.

This internship was done sucessfully in AEGCL (ASSAM ELECTRICITY GRID CORPORATION LIMITED) and the notes related to the internship is provided here.
Assam Electricity Grid Corporation Limited (AEGCL) is a State Public Sector Company of Assam, India registered under ‘The Companies Act, 1956’.

Its core business is to efficiently transport electrical power from electrical power bulk heads to the distribution company networks in the state of Assam.

In this repository I have given a day wise split up to help students get an understanding about the things present inside a grid station.

The actual duration of the internship was 10 days but I have written it for 4 days as other days were either mostly repetative or consumed in report making and official documentation.
